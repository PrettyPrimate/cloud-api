The Task
What is required for this technical exercise

An interface (e.g., class library or API) that exposes the option to create, update,

and return a list of items.

Considerations
Things to look out for and implement when completing this technical exercise
1. The task is simple, and the scope is purposely broad, to encourage the Software Engineer to
add features to showcase their talent and knowledge.
2. It is not important that the exercise is 100% completed nor polished; it is important that the
exercise showcases the ability to think about considerations for production ready quality
code in a modern distributed cloud native environment.
3. Examples of showcasing of work may include, but is not limited to:
a. having methods (within classes) that throw “not implemented” exceptions, and are
covered by failing Unit Tests
b. having a CI/CD pipeline
c. implementing a solution that uses cloud native features
d. using a modern User Interface
e. adding options to allow for scale or performance (e.g., data stores, event
driven/sourcing, messaging, redundancy, & etc.)
f. implementing Integration tests
4. The overall task should NOT take more than a few hours.
Evaluation
How the results of the exercise will be assessed on completion
1. A solution based on .NET with Unit Tests
2. Source code should be placed on a repo on GitHub or Azure DevOps
3. There should be a README.md file that includes:
a. A Solution description
b. Features that were
i. implemented
ii. partially implemented (if any)
iii. considered that should be implemented (if any)

4. A Q&A session where the developer would be expected to explain and justify their technical
decisions, explain features considered.
